# Setting up the MacBook Pro - Ryan Tan - Medium
oh. so. pro.

So I have done it, put down the money and got the 2021 MBP with the M1 Pro chip.

But, as with each new Mac, I am always missing things that I use all the time, so I decided a while back to just note it all down in a Github repo.

Initially, I just had a script that installed everything at one go. But I keep facing errors with each new OS and 3rd party libraries get outdated all the time. What this meant was that I would get a whole bunch of errors and things just fail. And because of the scripts being dependent on each other, it was just frustrating to run and to debug.

So I learnt a new trick this time and used `select` instead:

yeah, you are awesome!

So, this would actually give you a simple menu like this to choose what you would like to install.
